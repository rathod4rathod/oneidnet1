     Promotions and General Marketing & Advertising in the Corporate Office Module require users representing a Company or Organization to take the following steps: Select the Corporate Office Register Link from the top header of the Corporate Office Module.

After completion of these steps, the user agrees to the Corporate Office Services agreement and proceeds to pay. The pay step redirects the user to Paybook where the user completes the transaction for payment. After payment is approved, the user can then commence use of the Corporate Office Service Package. This is the same process for other specific Corporate Office Module services a Company or Organization may want to select to enhance their operational activities.
