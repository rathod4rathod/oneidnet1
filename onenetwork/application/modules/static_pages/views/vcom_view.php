        <li>  vCOM is the ONEIDNET System voice and video communication Module; the user's activities in the vCOM Module are for social and professional communication with Users, Companies, Organizations or external contacts.

        <li> vCOM users may not insult, antagonize or threaten other vCOM users. vCOM users who perform these types of activities adopt the risk of the vCOM user's profile being suspended and/or revoked. </li>
        <li>  Promotions and General Marketing & Advertising in the vCOM Module require users representing a Company or Organization to take the following steps: Select the vCOM Register Link from the top header of the vCOM Module. The System redirects the user to the OneNetwork Module to the vCOM's Packages page. On the vCOM's Packages page review and select the desired vCOM Package. The System redirects the user to the selected vCOM Package page; here the user fills in all required basic information and audience lab for the Service Package selected. After completion of these steps, the user agrees to the vCOM Services agreement and proceeds to pay. The pay step redirects the user to Paybook where the user completes the transaction for payment. After payment is approved, the user can then commence use of the vCOM Service Package. This is the same process for expanding communications services in the Corporate Office Module. </li>
        <li>Promoting vCOM Company events and upcoming products or services is performed through the same Promotion Engine. The type of Promotion should be specified. </li>
        <li>Upon successful Registration in the OneNetwork Module, the user representing a Company or Organization is issued a ONEIDNET ID, which gives the user Official Identity in the System.
 </li>
 <li> vCOM users may change their vCOM Settings by selecting the Settings Link from the top header of the vCOM Module.  In the same drop down menu, vCOM users may Report a Problem, View the vCOM Privacy Policy and read over Help tips.</li>
 <li>The vCOM Menu contains all information regarding the vCOM user’s activities in the vCOM Module.  Here, the user can manage their System wide contacts, verify and communicate with the user’s social and professional networks. The user profile may also be created and/or modified as per user options. </li>
 <li> vCOM users requiring assistance or support may get support by selecting the ONEIDNET Customer Support Link from the ONEIDNET Information Box at the top right hand corner of the vCOM user's Control Panel. Here the user selects the vCOM System Module or the desired ONEIDNET Division and the area for which the vCOM user requires assistance or support. After this, the user completes the personal information and submits the request for support.  A ONEIDNET representative will respond to the vCOM user's request. </li>
 <li> vCOM users should refrain from introduction of scams, phishing, or deceitful use of the vCOM Module or any other Module in ONEIDNET.</li>
 <li> If a vCOM user encounters a problem, the specified problem should be reported immediately.</li>
 <li>Users of the vCOM Module can register in the OneNetwork Module to ensure the user's information is readily available in the event that the user requires additional space to store the user’s e-mail data.  Users must register to have an official ONEIDNET ID to play in vCOM. </li>
