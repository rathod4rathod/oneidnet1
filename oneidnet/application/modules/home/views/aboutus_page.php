                        </div>

                    <div class="main_content">We are a company with the
                        commitment to provide people around the world with
                        the opportunity to utilize their extremely valuable
                        time in productive ways. We do this by providing people
                        with a new way to use the World Wide Web to their best
                        possible potential. The ONEIDNET Internet System provides
                        multiple free services for people, which in-turn allows
                        them to capitalize on their capabilities and capacities
                        to pursue new opportunities.</div>

                       <div class="main_content">The ONEIDNET Internet System is powered by 16 interactive and interfacing Modules, these Modules are part of the System Control Panel and the Modules are the tools people use to make the System work for them. These 16 System Modules include 360° Mail, Click, Buzzin, Tunnel, Vcom, OneShop, NetPro, Corporate Office, CvBank, Travel Time, OneIDship, FindIt, ISnews, OneVision, DealerX and OneNetwork.

 </div>



                  	<div class="main_content">
                Through ONEIDNET, people are able to create their CVs with a new and enhanced approach, the CvBank Module within the system is designed to cover every possible detail of a person’s qualifications and credentials, in this way, when a company performs a search for a candidate, the company is able to find the exact match for their needs in just a few minutes of using the system. Although, CvBank is not only about CVs, it interfaces with the NetPro and Corporate Office System Modules together with Vcom, 360° Mail and OneNetwork. It works like this, when a person completes their CV, any given company from around the world registered in ONEIDNET may search for that person’s CV, the company will search for their candidates by specifying the company’s exact requirements, if the person’s CV meets the company’s exact requirements, then it will be a 100% match for the company’s requirements, this will save companies a tremendous amount of time, cost and effort, the System will guide companies on how to find their 100% match candidate every time.</div>

                <div class="main_content">

    Once a company has selected the candidate they want to hire directly within the system, the company will proceed to schedule an interview within the system by using the 360° Mail Module to contact their selected candidate, the candidate will already know that his/her profile was viewed by the company and other companies, once he/she receives the 360° e-mail and he/she responds, then an interview can be scheduled also within the System by using the Vcom Module, which is used within the System by all users, the company will then schedule their candidate’s interview in Vcom and the candidate will be notified again using 360° Mail for the candidate’s acceptance to the interview

                </div>

                <div class="main_content">

                In Vcom, the candidate will be greeted by virtual assistants and the company’s representative will be notified that their candidate is ready for interview. If the company is satisfied with the candidate, then the company representative may request access to the candidate’s NetPro for verification of identity, credentials, certifications, licenses, education, work experience, etc. The SafeBox in NetPro contains all the candidate’s professional history with digital copies of their documents for the company’s HR verifications. Of course the company is already at this point registered as a Corporate Office entity within the ONEIDNET System by engagement with OneNetwork authorized personnel. This new process of recruiting and hiring new candidates saves companies invaluable time and use of resources aside from the cost reduction by not having to pay for separate recruiting agencies and head hunters’ fees to acquire new qualified candidates, with separate agencies generally providing unqualified candidates and internal HR not possessing an effective system to find qualified candidates.</div>

                <div class="main_content">
             In the ONEIDNET System, companies can establish their offices by using the Corporate Office Module, in Corporate Office, companies can set up their ONEIDNET office with the spaces and address they need to perform their operations, companies will also be able to make use of all the tools available in the System to recruit, and market and advertise their products and services, all with the largest audience in the world through the ONEIDNET OneNetwork. The public exposure to billions of users and time, cost and effort savings for companies when they register in ONEIDNET is incomparable. Companies may also be individual consultants.
                </div>

                <div class="main_content">
                Any company will have their network companies and System users who are representatives of their companies will also have their networks, which will be available from companies and single users within the System from around the world. This is the perfect systematic venue to be able to market and advertise any company’s products and/or services. Companies will take advantage of general, elite and special marketing and advertising options available within the ONEIDNET System.

                </div>

                <div class="main_content">

                A company will designate their ONEIDNET representatives and register them under the company name in Corporate Office with their respective job titles, organization and structure. This designation is done once the company registers for services through Corporate Office with the specified users and the responsible party for their particular office. All service agreements for all System Modules are done through OneNetwork as this is the ONEIDNET personnel administrative Module and the contact for every ONEIDNET System user. Once the company is registered in the System, the company can take advantage of all the benefits available.
                </div>

                <div class="main_content">People and companies alike will be able to establish their own stores within the ONEIDNET System, by using the OneShop Module, a person who has never owned a store or business previously now can start their own without the hassle of having to rest or pay for store space, without having to deal with the absurd regulations imposed in their countries and be able to start earning profits without any fees for 6 months, then after 6 months continue for a very minor monthly fee to maintain their store and data storage necessary for their online store to function. Existing companies of all sizes may also establish their store in the ONEIDNET System.

                </div>


                <div class="main_content"> A person will already have their networks in the multiple ONEIDNET System Modules, these will be both social and professional networks. With the consideration that people generally have thousands of other people in their networks, just imagine how many people any given person will have in 16 networks as a complete and integrated system. This is amazing selling power for any person in OneShop, because not only will that person be able to market and advertise to their own networks, but also to the entire ONEIDNET System network, which will be in the billions. The exposure for a person’s products and services will be unlike any other method used in the past.  For example, a person has 3,525 friends in Click, 2,850 in Buzzin, 1,838 in the Tunnel, 2,340 connections in NetPro, 989 connections in OneShop, and another 11,350 in the rest of the System, now that is some selling power because that person’s entire network will be exposed to their products and services depending on how that person manages their networks.

                </div>

                <div class="main_content">

                People just have to go to OneShop and open a store, in the process of opening their store, they will also designate their store representatives, organization and structure with the responsible party for the particular store. In the process, people will specify, identify and describe their products and services in their store to then have them published to the world. During the process of establishing a store, the user will be prompted to register to Corporate Office as an individual consultant or as a company, once this is done, the user will effectuate their service agreements with OneNetwork and once this is done, the user can start to sell their products immediately. For buying purposes, a user does not need to establish a store, it’s just as simple as finding any store they wish to purchase in and go buy.
                </div>

                 <div class="main_content"> To be able to purchase from OneShop or purchase any other products and services within the System, when a user initially registers in the System, the user is instructed to complete their NetPro profile, the information from the NetPro profile proliferates throughout the System to all the Modules, included in NetPro is a section where the user will fill in their financial information in PayBook.
                 </div>

                 <div class="main_content"> The System is integrated to work with interfaces between the Modules for optimal effectiveness and efficiency.

                 </div>

                 <div class="main_content"> In the System, Vcom is always available for all users within the System to communicate individually or as groups, the Vcom Module will work individually or with multiple users for personal or professional use.

People may use Instant Messaging for quick personal communication, but 360° Mail for official and professional communication.  360° Mail is used throughout the System to communicate between the System Modules.

                 </div>

                <div class="main_content">When people want to socialize, they can take advantage of the Click, Buzzin and Tunnel Modules, or even Travel Time as people will be able to share their amazing vacation and travel stories. In Click, people form their clicks with their friends and networks and interact in their social clicks, all the person has to do is Click Here.  In Buzzin, people can express their talents and creativity to let the world know what they are able to do such as actors and actresses.  We all love a little bit of fun and fame every now and then.

                  <div class="sub_heading_content">PHILOSOPHY</div>

                  <div class="main_content">All personnel at ONEIDNET together believe that when a company gives people what they need and actually cares about people and treats people with dignity that company is in for a very long lasting relation with people. This is one primary philosophy of our core values and the reason why we provide so many free services, give people prices, provide the opportunity for people to make money, assist people in getting jobs, assist companies in finding candidates directly, faster and cheaper.
                  </div>

                  <div class="main_content">Our aim is to always treat people with human dignity. This means that we will never try to squeeze people for their money where there is no more money to be squeezed. These have been the practices for centuries across the world.  ONEIDENT stands against this practice, we want to empower people and provide them with the opportunity to grow personally and professionally.
                    </div>

                   <div class="main_content">Together, ONEIDNET with its users will re-write history, together we will redefine the Internet with the people’s dignity and justice as the primary goal; no longer will people feel fear because together we will ensure that people are empowered to live in a world of real justice.

                   </div>



                   <div class="sub_heading_content">PERSONALIZATION</div>

                  <div class="main_content">ONEIDNET made its Internet System so that it included the flexibility for users to personalize the way they want to see and use the Internet.  How amazing is that? ONEIDNET provides users with a control screen that actively broadcasts multiple activities and notifications for different Services in different Modules. For example, when users want to research for something in the Internet, they will be able to filter their searches by topic or research area so that the most relevant results come up in the Find It Module; although, ONEIDNET does not intend to take on this practice to charge money for searches, because we believe it wastes users’ time and effectiveness in finding information in the Internet, we believe this is not a good service to our users.
                   </div>

                    <div class="main_content">ONEIDNET users are able to activate the Module or Service they want to work on at the time and being able to change it immediately. Additionally, users can designate how they want their Internet System to look and which way they want to use the Internet. That is a significant change, which is a tremendous benefit to users personally, professionally, businesswise, for employers, for companies, for all types of organizations, in short, the system is an invaluable benefit for all.
                  </div>


                  <div class="sub_heading_content">NO MORE MULTIPLE IDs AND PASSWORDS SCRAMBLES</div>

                  <div class="main_content"> One of the most bothersome facts of the Internet is that users around the world have to go and establish separate accounts in multiple websites to satisfy their Internet needs. As a result of this created Internet condition, users must register to each separate website and choose an ID and password. In the end, Internet users have to try to keep over 20 separate IDs and passwords, if these IDs and passwords are not saved somewhere accessible, the user ends up forgetting most of the IDs and passwords.
                  </div>

                  <div class="main_content"> Most organizations that have tried to resolve the issue of multiple IDs and passwords have attempted to create applications to collect the separate IDs and passwords people use to identify them to a single unique ID and password, what happens with that
                  approach is that all it does is create more work and headaches for the user because now they have to go and recapture every one of their IDs and passwords and take the time to go to the designated
                  application and input all the information, most users around the world are not willing to spend the time it takes to process. Aside from the effort to consolidate IDs and passwords, the user still has to maintain profiles in separate websites and continue to use separate websites, thus, making the attempt not successful.
                  </div>
                 <div class="main_content">No organization in the past has ever thought or even considered the integration of multiple internet websites into one complete system and
                 this is what ONEIDNET has done for its users. ONEIDNET integrates multiple services into one Internet System, which has never been done before and is a powerful System for users.
                </div>

                  <div class="main_content"> ONEIDNET resolves the issue of multiple IDs and passwords and the need to use multiple websites, empowering users to be able to control the Internet

                   <div class="main_content">The ONEIDNET Internet System is a new technology developed to solve problems in multiple fronts. The system resolves existing internet problems at the international, national and local levels enhancing professional and personal activities. This system includes 16 different modules that together make the integrated Internet System.
                   This system was developed using unique code, with a single platform, while usingmultiple-unique data bases. It is a new way of using the World Wide Web much needed by people around the world.
                   </div>

                   <div class="sub_heading_content"> Internationally:</div>

                    <div class="main_content">
                    1. This new technology improves world-wideunemployment rates for people in general and in different industries and fields of study and professions when one examines the System benefits in detail. This is possible through an international database available in CvBank with curriculum vitae that is accessible directly to companies, industries, enterprises, governments and all kinds of identities organized for recruitment within the system, the CvBank Module servicesare free for people.
                    </div>
                    <div class="main_content">
                    2. Companies, industries, enterprises, governments and organized identities can access the system in detail and choose the candidate with the characteristics, qualities, level of education, experience, geographic area, years of experience, field of study and field experience, qualifications, credentials, professions, etc. They make their recruitment of new staff through the system without having to pay a recruitment agencies or head hunters for personnel at extraordinary costs that can reach $ 40,000- $ 50,000 for just one professional such as a program director with 20-25 years’ experience that a company is in need for in a specific project or to fill an empty position in their organization. If the organization requires 10 professionals immediately to fill within 3 months, then they will pay approximately $ 400,000- $ 500,000 for all professionals and thus be able to undertake any given project or new requirement. The system replaces these costs for a minimal cost, for example, $ 2,999                         monthly, where organizations can then get 10 professionals for the same cost as a much more reasonable price. Organizations can run their recruitments completely through the system.

                    <div class="main_content">
                    3. The Internet inherently has several problems; ONEIDNETresolves some of them for example, A) The Internet does not currently provide the desirable results when someone does a search for specific topicsas the current trend is for companies to pay service providersto show their companies in the first or second pages of results from the search, whether the results are relevant to the people or not. New algorithms will enable when a person does a search, to get relevant results related to their search. B) The Internet is not personalized, (i.e. when a person access the Internet, they dive into an unknown world, where others establish the criteria and parameters of what the person will experience when using the Internet, this maintains a person so distant from what that person would like to have at their fingertips and available in the form they need it); ONEIDNET makes it possible for a person to customize their own Internet.

                    <div class="main_content">
                    4. In the Internet there is excessive waste of time by people who use social networks; people spend several hours every day browsing social networks without making fruitful use of their time, without results that will bring benefits for them. This new technology through the ONEIDNET System makes it possible for people to stop wasting time on social networks and achieve beneficial results with their time on activities that give them useful possibilities. The number of hours lost by people who waste their time on the Internet for social activities is alarming, the hours spent are baffling figures and exceed numbers in trillion annually, this effect of social networks is unprecedented and something should be done about it . ONEIDNET resolves that problem.

                    <div class="main_content">
                    5. This new way of using the Internet through the System makes it possible for a person who has never been able to start a business be able to do it for free; a person who has never been able to establish a business due to economic, legal limits, unreasonable governments, etc. Now, through ONEIDNET a person can start their small business without having to make unnecessary payments to start. This is a great benefit to people who have been limited and currently have no possibility to start a business. This will give big power to the people in general at the international level in order to correct the absurd restrictions that governments in many countries impose on the people; in this way, low-income people have the opportunity to expand their capabilities and establish an alternative to the lack of employment world-wide.

                    <div class="main_content">
                    6. People in general may have communication either by voice or video without having to pay for telephone services. One of our goals is to make communication services free for people.

                     7. In our modern world, there is now the problem of disinformation, this is the discriminatory use of the media to provide news and reports to people around the world that are not true, which aims to defraud communities in general, making them believe that a certain government, agency, institution or organized identity is performing certain activities when in reality they are trying to get the public to not realize the truth. News agencies are committing atrocities and tyranny against the people world-wide. This ONEIDNET through the System focuses on reporting the truth to the public

                 We believe that developing a new technology and a new system that will be for human benefit speaks for itself on innovation. But to be an innovative and critical thinkerone must realize two things: 1) What people want? and 2) What people need? If it is innovative, the solution must resolve the question of what people want, and if an entity can provide what people want at the cheapest price, in the shortest time possible,
                 and as easy as possible that entity will have a lasting business. However; if the entity considers what people really need, and if that entity can provide what people need at the cheapest price, in the shortest time possible, and as easy as possible that entity will achieve a permanent business
