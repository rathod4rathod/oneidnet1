                <h2 class="sub_heading_content">ALL IN ONE SYSTEM:</h2>
                <div class="main_content">
                	<ul class="terms-list">
                    	<li>The ONEIDNET founder several years ago asked himself, why are people wasting so much time on the Internet without any productivity?</li>
                        <li>Is it possible to make a system that will allow people to socialize and at the same time utilize their time in a productive manner?</li>
                        <li>Could a system be made that includes personal and professional activities?</li>
                        <li>Why do people have over 20 different IDs and passwords?</li>
                        <li>People constantly have to recover their passwords, why?</li>
                        <li>Why do people have to go to multiple websites on the Internet to get what they need?</li>
                        <li>Could it be possible to make an Internet System where people only need one ID and password?</li>
                        <li>One Internet System where people get everything they need from one place?</li>
                        <li>One Internet System that gives to people instead of taking from them the little they have?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="main_content">After extensive analysis, evaluation, considerations, financial constraints, answering all the questions and formidable obstacles, the founder came up with the concept/idea of ONEIDNET, which with perseverance became a real Internet System. A System where people can do everything they need all in one place without having to go to multiple websites. A beautifully integrated Internet System where there are no limits for the user to grow.</p>
                
                
                <h2 class="sub_heading_content">PERSONALIZED INTERNET SYSTEM:</h2>
                <p class="main_content">ONEIDNET made its Internet System so that it included the flexibility for users to personalize the way they want to see and use the Internet.  How amazing is that? ONEIDNET provides users with a control screen that actively broadcasts multiple activities and notifications for different Services in different Modules. For example, when users want to research for something in the Internet, they will be able to filter their searches by topic or research area so that the most relevant results come up in the Find It Module; although, ONEIDNET does not intend to take on this practice to charge money for searches, because we believe it wastes users’ time and effectiveness in finding information in the Internet, we believe this is not a good service to our users.</p>
                <p class="main_content">ONEIDNET users are able to activate the Module or Service they want to work on at the time and being able to change it immediately. Additionally, users can designate how they want their Internet System to look and which way they want to use the Internet. That is a significant change, which is a tremendous benefit to users personally, professionally, business-wise, for employers, for companies, for all types of organizations, in short, the system is an invaluable benefit for all.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sub_heading_content">NO MORE SEPARATE WEBSITES AND ID SCRAMBLES:</h2>
                <p class="main_content">One of the most bothersome facts of the Internet is that users around the world have to go and establish separate accounts in multiple websites to satisfy their Internet needs. As a result of this created Internet condition, users must register to each separate website and choose an ID and password. In the end, Internet users have to try to keep over 20 separate IDs and passwords, if these IDs and passwords are not saved somewhere accessible, the user ends up forgetting most of the IDs and passwords.</p>
                <p class="main_content">Most organizations that have tried to resolve the issue of multiple IDs and passwords have attempted to create applications to collect the separate IDs and passwords people use to identify them to a single unique ID and password, what happens with that approach is that all it does is create more work and headaches for the user because now they have to go and recapture every one of their IDs and passwords and take the time to go to the designated application and input all the information, most users around the world are not willing to spend the time it takes to process. Aside from the effort to consolidate IDs and passwords, the user still has to maintain profiles in separate websites and continue to use separate websites, thus, making the attempt not successful.</p>
                <p class="main_content">No organization in the past has ever thought or even considered the integration of multiple Internet services into one complete system and this is what ONEIDNET has done for its users. ONEIDNET integrates multiple services into one Internet System, which has never been done before and is a powerful System for users.</p>
                <p class="main_content">ONEIDNET resolves the issue of multiple IDs and passwords and the need to use multiple websites, empowering users to be able to control the Internet.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sub_heading_content">RELEVANT NEWS:</h2>
                <p class="main_content">One of the objectives of ONEIDNET is to broadcast news that matter to the user, the user will be able to designate the type of news they will see, listen to and read. We are interested in providing the ONEIDNET Internet System users with accurate information so that the user is not filled with vague ideas about what is actually happening around him/her in their local community, in their national context and the international news.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sub_heading_content">USER CONTROL:</h2>
                <p class="main_content">For years, since the World Wide Web came to existence and people around the world commenced to use it widely, the Internet has been controlled by others outside the realm of possibilities for each and every user to control their own Internet System.</p>
                <p class="main_content">ONEIDNET now makes it possible for single users to control their own Internet as a personalized System. Now, users no longer will have to go to the Internet without knowing who is controlling what and going into unknown cyber space. With ONEIDNET users know that he/she controls their own Internet content, he/she controls what happens in their own System.</p>
                
                 <h2 class="sub_heading_content">BETTER MARKETING AND ADVERTISING:</h2>
                <p class="main_content">Since Marketing and Advertising is not the only source for ONEIDNET, we can control the abrasive nature of Ads as they have been typically pushed and forced in devices for users to be forced to view them.</p>
                <p class="main_content">ONEIDNET has specially developed Modules for a more tasteful manner of marketing and advertising. The marketing and advertising options used by ONEIDNET do not push Ads with forceful nature for users to see.</p>
