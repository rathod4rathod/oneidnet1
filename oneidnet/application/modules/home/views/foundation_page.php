                       <div class="main_content">The ONEIDNET founder, in 2008 set out to resolve the following discrepancies currently affecting the performance of the Internet: Why are people wasting so much time on the Internet without any productivity? Is it possible to make a system that will allow people to socialize and at the same time utilize their time in a productive manner? Could a system be made that includes personal and professional activities? Why do people have over 20 different IDs and passwords? People constantly have to recover their passwords, why?
                       Why do people have to go to multiple websites on the internet to get what they need? Could it be possible to make an Internet System where people only need one ID and password? One Internet System where people get everything they need from one place? One Internet System that gives to people instead of taking from them the little they have?

                  	<div class="main_content">After extensive analysis, evaluation, considerations, financial constraints, answering all the questions and formidable obstacles, the founder came up with the concept/idea of ONEIDNET, which with it became a real Internet System. A System where people can do everything they need all in one place without having to go to multiple websites.
