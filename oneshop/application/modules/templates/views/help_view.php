    <h3 class="fll wi100pstg"> Starting a Store: </h3>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
A user who takes the initiative to start a store in OneShop will select the option to create a store from the OneShop menu. In the create a store panel the user designates the name of the store, the type of store, and then incorporates the store Logo. Once this is done, the user may assign the store personnel who will be working as store representatives and assign titles for the store management.  The store administrator has the authority to assign store personnel and to create and modify store reports, activities, respond to purchases, start their purchase process, process the purchased items and complete the purchase with the last step of shipping the purchased product(s) and or provide their service(s).
 </p>
 <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
  Daily, weekly and monthly reports can be generated in the administration section of the user’s store(s). Accounting tools are also available for users to manage and operate their stores. Once the respective personnel designations are completed and management is established, the store administrator can add their respective products and/or services with images, descriptions, cost, shipping and handling information and offers they may have to provide competitive prices.   
 </p>
 <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
     In the process of creating a store the user is redirected to the OneNetwork Module to select the store package the user wants to select. There are several options of size and types of stores for selection.

    <h3 class="fll wi100pstg"> Maintaining a Store: </h3>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
       
If the store is a new store from a store owner that has never had a business whether at a physical location or ecommerce, the user is not liable to make payment for the support ONEIDNET offers to maintain their store in OneShop for a period of 3 months. </p>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
        Stores for which owner has had a business prior to opening a store in OneShop is required to pay a minor monthly fee for ONEIDNET to maintain, operate, mange data storage and provide store services.
    </p>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
      All packages and prices are defined and available in the OneNetwork Module of the System.

    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
In the same manner as every other Module in the System, the OneShop Module offers the option for users to Register for Module services, the user selects this option to Register in OneNetwork, in the registration process the user identifies himself or herself as a registered ONEIDNET user with their associated account. Upon selection of the desired Module Service package, the user is redirected to the Paybook panel to make payment and payment arrangements for future months. The user would have already completed the input of financial information into Paybook when the user first registers into the system, if this task was not performed initially; the user is prompted to complete the Paybook information prior to processing payment. </p>

    <h3 class="fll wi100pstg"> Payment Process</h3>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
   
For OneShop Module Services, users make their own prices and policies for their respective stores. Other System users who purchase products and/or services from a OneShop store make their payment through Paybook, the OneShop store then delivers or ships the product or service and their order is complete.
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
        More information regarding the payment process is available in the OneShop Module Services agreement, which is executed for store owners to receive ONEIDNET services through the system.

<div class="fll wi100pstg np_des_mat25">
    
    <h3 class="fll wi100pstg"> OneShop User’s Network </h3>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
   
One of the most important considerations here is the OneShop store owner’s ONEIDNET network.  The owner as a ONEIDNET user should import their connections and friends from all known networks where these connections and networks are, because this network will become the user’s primary source of marketing and advertisement.  The moment a user opens up a store to commence selling their products and/or services, every other ONEIDNET user in their network will receive a notification that the user has just opened a new store and their store will be visible to the user’s network to browse and evaluate.  These will be the primary audience for the OneShop store owner’s customers.  Naturally, the larger the user’s ONEIDNET network is the more probability the user has for potential sales. </p>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
     For example, if a user has a wood crafts shop already physically located at some location in the world but does not have the type of exposure available in the ONEIDNET OneShop Module, the user’s wood crafts shop does not get much marketing or advertising attention, thus reducing sales potential to a minimum. Once the user opens up their OneShop store, they will enjoy the attention and notification of their network because a typical user with both social and professional networks is likely to have connections and friends, which are located in diverse areas of the world, in this manner extending the user’s OneShop store to a world audience without the necessity to spend money for external marketing and advertising. For every activity the store owner performs in their OneShop store, their respective network is notified expanding the user’s potential for sales.   
    </p>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
    This makes OneShop a powerful selling tool for OneShop store owners.    
    </p>
   
</div>
    <div class="fll wi100pstg np_des_mat25">
    
    <h3 class="fll wi100pstg"> OneShop ONEIDNET Network </h3>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
   
The OneShop store owner already has their own network as an audience, which is already a significant pool of people for substantial sales. However; the use will also have the overall ONEIDNET network available to him/her to have as an audience for their store sales.
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
     While a user may have a network of let us say approximately 15,000 users, the extended ONEIDNET network with millions of people truly give a boost for sales to every user in the System who decides to open a store in the ONEIDNET OneShop Module.

        <div class="fll wi100pstg np_des_mat25">
            <h2 class="fll wi100pstg" style="color:blue"> CONNECTIONS </h2>
    <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
    <h3 class="fll wi100pstg"> Social </h3></p>
   <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
The OneShop store owner’s social friends include those friends from Click, Buzzin, the Tunnel, DealerX, FindIt, ISNews, vCom, OneVision and Travel Time. This network is the store owner’s primary source for their store sales. These are the System Modules where social interactions become a critical aspect of the user’s system potential for business in the OneShop Module.

These are the System Modules where professional relations become a critical aspect of the user’s system potential for business in the OneShop Module.
