            <p>

                In the OneShop Module, to rise to the top levels of sales in Stores’ products and services, ONEIDNET recommends following the below listed considerations: </p>

            <div class="fll wi100pstg">
                <ul style="list-style:none;">
                    <li>
                        <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">

                            1. Build your social network in the ONEIDNET System. Bring all your friends from any outside social platform where you are connected to build your social network in the Click, Buzzin, Tunnel, vCom, DealerX, OneVision and Travel Time Modules. This will help you increase your social network and thus increase your Store’s exposure for sales.  When you create a Store and start selling your products and services, your entire network gets notifications, thus creating your marketing and advertising automatically, increasing your probability for growth. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">

                            2. Build your professional network in the ONEIDNET System. Bring all your connections from any outside professional platform where you are connected to build your professional network in the OneNetwork, Tunnel, Corporate Office, OneShop, FindIt, cvBank, NetPro, 360<sup style="font-size:6px;">O</sup> Mail, ISNews, Travel Time, vCom, OneVison and OneIDShip  Modules. This will help you increase your professional network and thus increase your Store’s exposure for sales.  When you create a Store and start selling your products and services, your entire network gets notifications, thus creating your marketing and advertising automatically, increasing your probability for growth. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">

                            3. Build relations with other business, companies, organizations and entities in the ONEIDNET System. This will also increase your own business exposure to a wider network than your social and professional ones. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
                            4. Your ONEIDNET System wide network should be as high as possible with as many connections as possible to make your marketing & advertising audience the largest pool of users possible. By the time you accumulate your entire ONEIDNET network, you should have at minimum 15,000 connections to give you a wide margin of marketing support for your OneShop Store sales. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="np_des_mat10 lh20 fs14 justify fll wi100pstg">
                            5. Lastly, create your store fast, because the OneShop Module is set to become one of the most popular Modules of the ONEIDNET System.  If you get your Store running first, you will get the biggest audience from the ONEIDNET wide network and therefore, making your Store more visible to every user in the System.  </p>
