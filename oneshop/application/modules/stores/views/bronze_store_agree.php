    2. About ONEIDNET:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET is an integrated operating system with a marketplace that allows
    users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a variety of pricing
    formats and locations. The actual contract for sale is directly between the
    Store and buyer. ONEIDNET is not a traditional merchant or retailer. Any
    guidance we provide as part of our Services, such as stores, stores
    locations, and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to
    follow it or not. Also, while we are not in a contractual position to help
    arbitrate between merchants and consumers, ONEIDNET has no control over and
    does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items
    advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the
    ability of Stores to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or
    that a buyer or Store will actually complete a transaction or return an
    item.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET is a service integrator that uses its oneShop module as a
    facilitator for stores to sell their products through the ONEIDNET
    integrated networks. Stores in oneShop are independent entities using their
    own policies and regulations for the sales of their products between the
    store and their buyers. ONEIDNET does not interfere in the business or
    transactions of stores in their entirety. There are different types of
    retail, convenience and specialty stores in oneShop. ONEIDNET provides
    tools for oneShop registered stores to manage their stores and store
    activities. Sizes of stores include new, extra-small new or existing, small
    new or existing, intermediate new or existing, medium new or existing,
    large new or existing, extra-large new or existing, and mega stores with
    more than 7,000 products in the system. Descriptions of store types and
    sizes are located in the ONEIDNET oneNetwork module. ONEIDNET charges
    different fees depending on the type and size of store that is registered
    in oneShop. This particular merchant agreement applies to INTERMEDIATE NEW
    OR EXISTING STORES.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET is under no binding obligation and is indemnified in its entirety
    for any and all activities arising from transactions being done in oneShop
    between stores and their store customers and/or buyers.

    with no advance notice required for any changes that result in the
    reduction of fees. Fees for our ONEIDNET oneShop services vary according to
    store size and type.

<div>
    If you own a Store in ONEIDNET oneShop, you are liable for transaction fees
    between your store and your customers, arising out of all sales made using
    some or all of ONEIDNET oneShop, your fees for your transactions when your
    customers purchase your products are established by you, for your
    customers. At the moment when the customer purchases the products you sold
    to them, the transaction is made to ONEIDNET and ONEIDNET accepts the
    payment, then in-turn, ONEIDNET makes payment to you as the merchant after
    ONEIDNET splits its percentage fee from the payment, given your usage of
    ONEIDNET oneShop for the introduction to your buyer(s).
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    You must have at minimum one payment and one acceptance method on file in
    Paybook when selling through ONEIDNET oneShop and your buyers/customers pay
    all fees and applicable taxes associated with the product(s) via paybook at
    the time of the customer purchase. If the buyer’s payment method fails or
    the buyer’s account is past due, the transaction will not be possible for
    the purchase of the product and you and the buyer will be notified. We may
    collect amounts owed by charging other payment methods on file with us,
    retain collection agencies and legal counsel, suspend or limit Services,
    and, for accounts over 30 days past due, request that ONEIDNET deduct the
    amount owed from your ONEIDNET Paybook account balance. In addition, you
    will be subject to late fees.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET, or the collection agencies we may retain, may also report
    information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late
    payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be
    reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information
    ONEIDNET reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or
    TransUnion) please contact us at ONEIDNET customer support. If you wish to
    dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau
    regarding your ONEIDNET account, you must contact the collection agency
    directly.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    In any jurisdiction where ONEIDNET has an obligation to collect sales taxes
    on sales you make using ONEIDNET oneShop, we may collect such sales taxes
    from you via the payment method on file under the terms of the Billing
    Agreement or via any other means available to us.
</div>
<div>
    Store fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on ONEIDNET,
    whether on a web page, mobile device, tablet, laptop, desktop, or
    otherwise. We may display third-party advertisements (including links and
    references thereto) or other content in any part of our Services, in our
    sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or
    other credit to, Stores.

    your store. ONEIDNET can't guarantee the exact amount of time it will take
    for product listings to show up in your stores.
</div>
<div>
    Your fixed-price product listings are solely your store’s responsibility
    and ONEIDNET does not in any manner assume responsibility for your store’s
    products, the products’ quality, accuracy, cost, or otherwise, the
    products’ complete information or any and all interactions between your
    store and your customers.

    Content that violates any of ONEIDNET's policies may be modified,
    obfuscated or deleted at ONEIDNET's discretion.
</div>
<div>
    We will not revise product data associated with your product listings to
    supplement, remove, or correct information, unless your store’s products’
    listings violate ONEIDNET’s policies and/or local, regional or
    international laws and regulations.
</div>
<div>
    We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking
    for. Therefore, the appearance, creation of stores and/or placement of
    products’ listings in search and browse through results will depend on a
    variety of factors.
</div>
<div>
    You as the store owner are fully responsible for your store products’
    listings and every transaction with all its legal and commercial
    responsibilities.
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET's duplicate listings in the overall oneShop module of your
    products’ listings may also affect whether your listing appears in search
    results.
</div>
<div>
    Metatags and ONEIDNET module links that are included in a listing may be
    removed or altered so as to not affect search results,
</div>
<div>
    We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating
    your listings. Such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales
    and performance history of similar sold and current listings; results will
    vary for individual listings. To drive the recommendations experience, you
    agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your
    individual listings to those of other Stores.

    purchase your products when your customers commit to buy your products,
    your offers for products accepted by your customers,
</div>
<div>
    For motor vehicles and real estate, the offer initiates a non-binding
    transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying
    the Store's items or products and does not create a formal contract between
    the buyer and your store until the transaction is finalized and the final
    transaction is recorded in oneShop and payment is made in Paybook,
</div>
<div>
    We do not transfer legal ownership of any items or products from the stores
    to the buyer or have any responsibility whatsoever over any transactions

    currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Stores
    and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations
    applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of products.

    ONEIDNET System oneShop module, based on your shipping settings. You may
    adjust these settings as detailed in the oneShop module settings. If you
    list your items with an international shipping option, your store is
    completely responsible to shipping requirements. At all times, your store
    is fully responsible for shipping commitments locally, nationally, and
    internationally. ONEIDNET does not assume any responsibilities for your
    store’s commitments to shipping or delivery of your products.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>

    You and your store authorize us to use automated ONEIDNET tools to
    translate your oneShop content and store-to-customer communications, in
    whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are
    available to customers. The accuracy and availability of any translation
    are not guaranteed.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    One of the ways that you and your store may make your oneidnet.com oneShop

    To protect ONEIDNET from risk of liability for your actions as a Store,
    ONEIDNET recommends, and may continue to recommend, that ONEIDNET restrict
    access to a store or stores based on certain factors, including, but not
    limited to, selling history, Store performance, riskiness of the store
    category, store value, or the filing of a ONEIDNET oneShop violation case.
    This may result in ONEIDNET restricting access to your store in your
    ONEIDNET account.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>

    In connection with managed payments as described in Section 14, we may also
    restrict customer access to your store based on the factors described in

    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET provides you with information about other ONEIDNET users. You,
    your store, and/or your representatives agree you will use the information
    only for the purposes as it is provided to you. You may not disclose, sell,

<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    14. Additional Terms:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Returns and Cancellations:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Stores create their own rules and policies and can cite regulations to
    which they must adhere to in regards to the sales, shipments, deliveries,
    transactions, and/or activities to sell their products and services, and
    this includes the stores’ own rules, policies and cited regulations
    regarding returns and/or cancellations. Independent stores handle their
    replacements, returns, cancellations, and/or refunds according to their own
    policies and procedures.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    For all new stores, in products’ listings where returns are accepted buy
    the store, ONEIDNET has no binding obligations in the store’s return
    policies and/or whether or not the store accepts returns. Stores may remove
    or customize their return policies in their account settings and store
    profile within ONEIDNET oneshop. Where settings have been set to
    automatically generate fields for stores to implement their own store
    policies, including their returns, replacements and/or cancellation
    policies.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    When items are returned, to refund the buyer, you (as the oneShop Store)
    are responsible to communicate with your customers and decide whether or
    not you want to authorize refund amounts (in same or other currency) from
    your store account to directly refund your customers.
</div>
<div>
    The cost of returns, refunds, shipping and handling of products for items
    that are returned, refunded and/or replaces are the Store's responsibility
    in its entirety. You (as the oneShop Store) shall report to ONEIDNET
    oneShop with notifications of returns, replacements, and refunds through
    the oneShop store management tools.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    15. ONEIDNET oneShop Stores’ Money Back Guarantee:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Most ONEIDNET oneShop stores’ sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem
    with a purchase, the ONEIDNET oneShop Store Money Back Guarantee is the
    sole responsibility of the registered oneShop store and at the sole
    discretion of the store’s own and independent store policies. The oneShop
    Store is responsible to communicate with its customers and resolve issues.
    You, your store, and/or your representatives agree to comply with your
    oneShop registered store’s policies and permit that ONEIDNET arbitrate if
    the store fails to follow its own store policies.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    If you (as the oneShop Store), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required
    to reimburse a buyer under your own Store’s Money Back Guarantee Policies,
    and you fail to comply with your own policies, you authorize ONEIDNET to
    request that oneShop remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other
    currency) from your ONEIDNET Paybook account, place the amount on your
    invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file to issue to the buyer,
    which requires refund and/or replacement.
</div>
<div>
    We may suspend your ONEIDNET oneShop Store in whole or in part without
    notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of your
    own store’s Money Back Guarantee Policies.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    16. Paybook Payments:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    The payment process employed by ONEIDNET is for the user/buyer/customer to
    include their credit card(s) and/or bank account information in Paybook.
    Payments for products made by users/buyers/customers are made directly to
    ONEIDNET, then ONEIDNET makes payment to the oneShop store retaining its
    sales’ fees and disbursing the remaining amount to the store using the
    store’s credit card(s) and/or bank account information on file in the
    ONEIDNET Paybook records.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    When ONEIDNET oneShop Stores implement returns, refunds, and/or replacement
    policies and award refunds to the store’s customers, ONEIDNET will not
    issue reciprocal refunds to stores as the reason or cause for the refunds
    will always be between the oneShop store and the customer/buyer according
    to the oneShop store’s own and independent policies.
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET provides managed payments services, where ONEIDNET (the Paybook
    "payments entity") manages payments on behalf of Stores (such management
    described as "paybook payments"). All ONEIDNET oneShop Stores enroll in
    Paybook payments.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    When we enable your account for Paybook payments, to continue to list and
    sell through your ONEIDNET oneShop store, as processed by Paybook payments,
    each oneShop store registered in ONEIDNET must where applicable:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Provide ONEIDNET with information about you and/or your business to meet
    its compliance requirements, including information of business identity
    verification, and your business compliance as a oneShop store, as required
    by applicable laws and policies; and
</div>
<div>
    Provide bank account information for your checking account so that the
    ONEIDNET Paybook can link such checking account to your ONEIDNET account,
    allowing ONEIDNET to pay you;
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET Paybook may obtain information about you from third-parties to
    verify your identity, and for other purposes in connection with Paybook
    payments;
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET Paybook uses payments service providers to assist it in accepting
    mass payments and making mass payments, including companies that process
    payments, perform risk assessments (such as credit agencies) or compliance
    checks, and verify identity. ONEIDNET Paybook may send personal data
    associated with you and your account to such third-parties
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    ONEIDNET Paybook may, at its sole discretion, will make payments to you,
    your store, and/or your representatives even if you haven't provided all
    requested information, and ONEIDNET Paybook may withhold payouts pending
    receipt of such information.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Contracts for sales underlying the purchases of goods is directly concluded
    between Store and the buyer or consumer in the same manner as for
    transactions for which the ONEIDNET Paybook handles payments for the
    purchases.
</div>
<div>

    substantial impact on how claims you and oneidnet have against each other
    are resolved:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    You and ONEIDNET agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has
    arisen, or may arise, between you and ONEIDNET (including any claim or

    relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this
    Marchant Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of
    ONEIDNET or its representatives, or services provided through the oneShop,
    will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this
    Agreement.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Applicable Law:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by

    of conflict of laws, will govern this Marchant Agreement and any claim or

    otherwise stated in this Marchant Agreement.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Agreement to Arbitrate:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    You and ONEIDNET each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have
    arisen, or may arise, between you and ONEIDNET (including any disputes or
    claims between you and a third-party agent of ONEIDNET) that relate in any
    way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the Marchant Agreement,
    your use of or access to the oneShop Services, the actions of ONEIDNET or
    its representatives, or any services offered through the oneShop shall be
    resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in
    court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if
    your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and
    advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The
    Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
    Agreement to Arbitrate.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
    Relief:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    YOU AND ONEIDNET AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
    ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
    PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR
    PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ONEIDNET AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR
    MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND
    MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE,
    CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
    ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND
    DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF
    AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT
    PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.
    If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this
    paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that
    claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be
    brought in court, subject to your and ONEIDNET's right to appeal the
    court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Arbitration Procedures:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
    neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an
    arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the
    same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
    individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the Marchant Agreement
    as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that
    issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this
    Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this
    Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions
    and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent
    jurisdiction to decide.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association
    ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer
    Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to
    Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. The use of the
    word "arbitrator" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more
    than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's
    rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an
    arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by
    certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice
    to ONEIDNET should be sent to Attn: ONEIDNET Builders International (BI)
    LLC at 603 Madison Ln Smyrna, Georgia 30080. ONEIDNET will send any Notice
    to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your
    ONEIDNET account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address
    up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided,
    including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is
    asserting and the relief sought.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    If you and ONEIDNET are unable to resolve the claims described in the
    Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or ONEIDNET may
    initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration
    proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to
    filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures,
    the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form
    to the opposing party. You may send a copy to ONEIDNET at the following
    address: Attn: ONEIDNET Builders International (BI) LLC at 603 Madison Ln
    Smyrna, Georgia 30080. In the event ONEIDNET initiates an arbitration
    against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical
    address we have on file associated with your ONEIDNET account. Any
    settlement offer made by you or ONEIDNET shall not be disclosed to the
    arbitrator.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    The arbitration hearing shall be held in the State of Georgia or at another
    mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $5,000 or
    less, you or ONEIDNET may elect to have the arbitration conducted by
    telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be
    binding on you and ONEIDNET subject to the arbitrator's discretion to
    require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where
    an in-person hearing is held, you and/or ONEIDNET may attend by telephone,
    unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
    applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor
    all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be
    bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is
    bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same ONEIDNET user to
    the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be
    final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
    be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Costs of Arbitration:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed
    by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
    Each party is responsible to pay their own filing, administration, and
    arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. If (a) you willfully fail
    to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed above, or (b) in
    the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the
    arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse ONEIDNET for all fees
    associated with the arbitration paid by ONEIDNET for arbitration and that
    you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Severability:
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement
    to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
    Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any
    part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other
    parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
